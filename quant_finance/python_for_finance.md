Commands to get started with basic development

- Bootstrap : start the docker container by 
docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash

- After logging into the container
jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 1111<docker container port> --allow-root

Some of the largest investment banks and hedge funds use Python and its ecosystem for building core trading and risk management systems.
Python packages can be used for financial data science, algorithmic trading and computational finance.

- Why Python for Finance
NumPy ndarray class and pandas DataFrame.
Availability of scientific stack distinguishes pytho from other languages.
LTCM(Long-Term Capital Management)
Trading, pricing, and risk management have become so complex for larger financial institutions that today they need to deploy IT infrastructures with thousands of computing cores.
Speed and Frequency, increasing data availability on ever-smaller time scales makes it necessary to react in real time.
On the other hand increasing speed and frequency of trading makes data volumes further increase. 
These processes reinforce each other and push average time scale for financial transactions systematically down.
Challenges : Data processing, Analytics Speed, Theoretical foundations : consistent financial concepts and theories in traditional sense are missing.
Sometimes lack of consistent theories often is addressed by technological approaches, where high speed algorithms exploit market microstructure elements (e.g. order flow, bid-ask spread) rather than some kind of financial reasoning.
Financial and Data Analytics: Applying software and technology in combination with algorithms to gather, process and analyze data, to gain insights, make decisions, fulfill regulatory requirements.
Two Challenges: BigData, Real-Time Economy
